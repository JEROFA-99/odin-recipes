    <h2>Wholesome Hearty French Toast</h2>
    <p>French Toast is as classic and French as it is Hearty. Be carefull though: eat too much of this fine French cuisine and all that awaits you is crippling obesity. Sweet, hearty, fun for the whole family, but maybe not as french as I had originally advertised.</p>
